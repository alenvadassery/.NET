<p><strong>Type</strong> is a general term referring to a member of the set <strong>{class, interface, structure, enumeration, delegate}</strong> Unlike many other languages, in C# it is <strong>not possible to create global functions or global points of data.</strong> Rather, all data members and all methods must be contained within a _type definition.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>  C# is a case-sensitive programming language. Therefore, Main is not the same as main.<br>
As a rule of thumb, whenever you receive a compiler error regarding “undefined symbols,” be sure to check your spelling and casing first.</p>
<p>Every executable C# application (console program, Windows desktop program, or Windows service) must contain a class defining a <strong>Main() method</strong>, which is used to signify the entry point of the application.</p>
<p>Formally speaking, the class that defines the Main() method is termed the <strong>application object.</strong></p>
